# PowerShellExcelMacros

This is a PowerShell script that will allow you to modify your macro settings in Excel from PowerShell.  It works by closing the existing Excel session you have open, applying the settings, and then opening it back up. 

This isn't the only way and it isn't the most efficient way, but I want to frame this in a way that would make sense to noobs.
